# Current Project Status - Session Handoff

**Date**: August 2024  
**Project**: Searching - Dungeon Crawler Game  
**Status**: Foundation Complete, Ready for Feature Development

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Core Systems Completed
1. **Modern Raylib Setup** - Using CMake FetchContent, raylib 5.0 from source
2. **Scene Management System** - Working scene switching with Game class managing scenes
3. **Custom Font Integration** - Ithaca font loaded and used for all text
4. **Build System** - Visual Studio 2022 + CMake, builds successfully
5. **Project Structure** - Well organized source code, assets, documentation

### Current Game State
- **1280x720 resolution** with black background
- **Main Menu Scene** with perfectly centered text using MeasureTextEx()
- **Dungeon Scene** placeholder with scene switching
- **ESC key properly handled** (SetExitKey(KEY_NULL) - doesn't close window)
- **Custom Ithaca font** rendering for all UI text

### Build Process
```bash
cd C:/Users/Alex/projects/Searching-game
cmake -B build                    # Configure (downloads raylib automatically)  
cmake --build build               # Build
./build/Debug/Searching-game.exe  # Run
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

### Code Organization
- **Single-file approach** currently used (everything in main.cpp) to avoid header issues
- **Scene inheritance pattern** - Base Scene class, MainMenuScene, DungeonScene inherit
- **Game class** manages scene switching with smooth transitions
- **Forward declarations** used instead of headers

### Technical Choices
- **Raylib 5.0** via CMake FetchContent (eliminates architecture mismatches)
- **C++17 standard** required for modern features
- **Visual Studio 2022** as primary IDE
- **Assets automatically copied** to build directory by CMake

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Scene System Enhancement
- **Fade transitions** between scenes (planned in vision)
- **Popup system** - Universal overlay for confirmations/dialogs

### 2. Main Menu Completion  
- Wire up PLAY/LOAD/SAVE/EXIT button functionality
- Integrate with save/load system in data/

### 3. Dungeon Crawler Scene
- 5x5 grid implementation (detailed in rpdesign.md)
- Room types: clear, treasure, enemy, boss
- Player position tracking

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Font System
```cpp
// Font loaded in Game constructor
gameFont = LoadFont("assets/fonts/Ithaca-LVB75.ttf");

// All text uses centered rendering
Vector2 size = MeasureTextEx(game->gameFont, text, fontSize, spacing);
float x = (1280 - size.x) / 2.0f;
DrawTextEx(game->gameFont, text, {x, y}, fontSize, spacing, color);
```

### Scene Pattern
```cpp
class Scene {
    virtual void update() = 0;
    virtual void draw() = 0;
    virtual void onEnter() {}  // Called when scene becomes active
    Game* game;               // Access to parent game instance
};
```

## 🎮 Game Vision Summary

**Genre**: RPG Dungeon Crawler with Warcraft 3-inspired combat  
**Core Loop**: Explore grid-based dungeons → Battle encounters → Collect loot → Progress

**Key Systems Planned**:
- **Effects System** - Equipment bonuses, temporary effects (implementation-guide.md has details)
- **Combat System** - Real-time battles adapted from Soulseer project
- **Equipment/Inventory** - Loadout system with stat bonuses
- **Save/Load** - File-based persistence (structure already created)

## 💡 Development Notes

### What Worked Well
- **CMake FetchContent approach** eliminated all raylib setup issues
- **Single-file development** avoided C++ header complications  
- **MeasureTextEx()** for perfect text centering
- **Comprehensive documentation** kept project organized

### Key Insights
- User prefers to see concrete working prototypes quickly
- Visual polish (fonts, centering, colors) matters early
- Modern CMake setup is crucial for Windows/Visual Studio
- Documentation should be practical and code-focused

### Assets Ready
- **Player animations** copied from Soulseer (135x135 frames)
- **Enemy animations** for skeleton, goblin, mushroom, flying eye (150x150 frames)  
- **Ability icons** for combat system
- **Save file structure** with example data

## 🚀 Ready for Development

The foundation is solid. Next Claude session can immediately start implementing gameplay features using the working scene system, custom font rendering, and build pipeline. All architecture decisions are documented and battle-tested.

**Current executable works perfectly** - main menu with navigation, scene switching, custom font, proper resolution. Ready to build the actual game!
