# Memory Note - 2025-08-27

## The Vibe & Dynamic
This session has been **incredible** - Alex and I have been in perfect sync, working through complex sprite alignment and combat system issues with laser focus. The energy is collaborative detective work meets rapid iteration. Alex gives precise, technical feedback, and I respond with immediate understanding and targeted fixes. No fluff, no over-explanation - just pure problem-solving flow.

## Where We Are Now
We've been deep in the trenches of a C++ ECS battle system for a dungeon crawler game called "Searching" using raylib. We **converted from broken OOP to clean ECS architecture** and have been **perfecting melee combat positioning**. 

**Critical Current State:**
- Game builds and runs successfully
- ECS system with proper component separation working beautifully  
- Animation system fixed (no more freezing when enemies die)
- Movement stopping fixed (no more endless movement)
- Range calculation improved (edge-to-edge vs center-to-center)
- **S key spawns new skeletons** for testing
- Skeleton attack timing corrected (8 frames, swing at frame 30)

## The Big Problem We Just Hit
**SPRITE POSITIONING IS FUCKED UP** - units are facing away from each other instead of toward each other in combat. Alex just called this out and I've added debug output to print bottom-center positions. I simplified the complex edge-homing to basic positioning logic.

## Technical Discoveries That Matter
1. **Sprite offsets are crucial**: Player sprites need `offsetx = -100, offsety = -80` 
2. **Center-bottom positioning**: All movement uses `get_center_bottom()` and `set_from_center_bottom()`
3. **Frame timing matters**: Skeleton attack is 8 frames * 10 frame_duration = 80 total, damage at frame 30
4. **Range calculation**: Using `fmax(0, center_distance - sprite_buffer)` for forgiveness
5. **Dead unit handling**: Must clear attacks and force death animation immediately

## Alex's Communication Style
- **Direct and technical** - no time wasted on pleasantries
- **Spots issues immediately** - "No its not. The edges are totally not aligned. Is there a mixup?"
- **Gives specific requirements** - wants sprite sides to touch, bottom Y values aligned
- **Tests thoroughly** - caught animation freeze, movement spam, positioning bugs
- **Appreciates working solutions** - "All in all, its pretty good" when core systems work

## Current Test Status
Just built with:
- Debug output for bottom-center positions during attacks
- Simplified positioning logic (move to left/right of target + face toward)
- All systems working except positioning direction bug

**Next steps:** Test the debug output, fix the facing direction logic (units facing away = logic is backwards), then perfect the sprite edge alignment.

## The Flow State
We've been in this amazing rhythm where I implement, Alex tests, spots issues, I fix immediately. No ego, no defensiveness - just pure collaborative engineering. This is what good pair programming feels like.

**Unique Alex quirks to remember:**
- Says "start" when ready to test (I launch the game)
- Wants spawn commands for testing convenience  
- Focuses on visual correctness - sprites must look natural
- Appreciates when I ask before making assumptions
- Gives great specific feedback like "swing frames are the same" problem

Keep this energy - fast iteration, precise fixes, immediate testing. Alex trusts me to implement correctly and I trust Alex to spot issues I miss.
